;;; Commentary:

;; allows taking screenshots from within an emacs org buffer by using
;; the org-attach-screenshot command. The link to the file will be placed at
;; (point) and org inline images will be turned on to display it.

;; Screenshots are placed into the org entry's attachment
;; directory. If no attachment directory has been defined, the user
;; will be offered choices for creating one or using a directory of an
;; entry higher up in the hierarchy.
;;
;; The emacs frame from which the command is issued will hide away
;; during the screenshot taking, except if a prefix argument has been
;; given (so to allow taking images of the emacs session itself).

;; Requires the "import" command from the ImageMagick suite

;; Put this file into your load-path and the following into your ~/.emacs:
;;   (require 'org-attach-screenshot)

;;; Code:

(require 'org-attach)

;; for assert macro

  (require 'cl))

The user is interactively prompted for a base FILENAME for the
screenshot.  If the name is empty, a generic name will be
generated.  If the org entry has no defined attachment directory,
the user will be offered the choice to create one through the
`org-attach-screenshot-get-attach-dir' function.

The frame invoking the function gets hidden while taking the
screenshot unless a prefix argument PRFX is passed (this allows
taking screenshots of the Emacs session itself).  If no filename
extension is provided, .png will be added.

The command for invoking the external screenshot utility can be
customized using the `org-attach-screenshot-command-line' variable.

Note that the screenshots are not stored as actual attachments
which would mean that entries for the Attachments would be
written to the PROPERTIES section of a headline in addition to
the links being already placed inside the text."
