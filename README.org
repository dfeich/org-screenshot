* Overview
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ATTACH_DIR: fig
  :END:
  org-attach-screenshot allows taking screenshots from within an emacs org
  buffer session.

  *Important note:* This package was originally named
  /org-screenshot/, but due to a name clash with one of the
  org-contrib packages, I decided to rename it to
  /org-attach-screenshot/.

  Features:
  - The link to the image file will be placed at /point/
  - /org inline images/ will be turned on to display it.
  - Screenshots are placed into the org entry's attachment
    directory.
  - If no attachment directory has been defined, the user will be
    offered choices for creating one or using a directory of an entry
    higher up in the hierarchy.
  - The emacs frame from which the command is issued will hide away
    during the screenshot taking, except if a prefix argument has been
    given (so to allow taking images of the emacs session itself).

* Installation and configuration
  Put org-attach-screenshot.el into your load-path and the following into
  your =~/.emacs=:

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'org-attach-screenshot)
  #+END_SRC

  You can customize the *command that is used for taking the screenshot*
  by configuring the =org-attach-screenshot-command-line= variable.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq org-attach-screenshot-command-line "mycommand -x -y -z %f")    
  #+END_SRC

  By default the =import= command from the ImageMagick suite is used, i.e.
  the variable is set to "import %f".

  You can also specify a *function for generating a directory name*, e.g. I
  often prefer to have the attachment directory names to be linked to the
  document name, so all screenshots and other material are in a directory
  that can be conveniently moved together with the main document. You
  can configure this by setting =org-attach-screenshot-dirfunction=
  to a function returning the directory name, e.g.

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-attach-screenshot-dirfunction
		(lambda () 
		  (progn (assert (buffer-file-name))
			 (concat (file-name-sans-extension (buffer-file-name))
				 "_att"))))
  #+END_SRC

  If =org-attach-screenshot-relative-links= is set to =t= the filename references
  placed in the org file will be relative filenames. This is probably the best
  default, since normally you want to be able to move the document together with
  its attachment directory. If you set this option to =nil= absolute path names
  will be used.

* Usage
  While in an org mode buffer, use the *org-attach-screenshot* command to take a screenshot and
  have it inserted at the current point.

  If the custom variable *org-attach-screenshot-relative-links* is non-nil, the
  links inserted in the org buffer will always be relative to the org
  document's location. If the variable is set to nil, the links will
  just be the concatenation of the attachment dir and the filename. So, if
  absolute path names are desired, you should set this option to nil and
  make sure that you specify absolute directory names for the attachment
  directories.

  If =org-attach-screenshot-auto-refresh= is set to =always= the buffers
  inline images will be automatically refreshed to display every
  inserted image immediately. Set this to =never= if you prefere to
  manually refresh inline images. In this case =org-attach-screenshot=
  will always just insert the link to the image file. Set this to =ask=
  if you want =org-attach-screenshot= to ask you after every insertion
  if you would like to refresh the buffer's inline images.

* Motivation
  Org with its Babel functionality is a great tool for producing technical
  documentation. One can directly use code snippets to produce graphics and
  have them rendered into the document. So, it is great for writing a manual
  about an application which produces graphics output.

  While working on my manual, I several times had to take screenshots in order
  to illustrate how to interact with the program. I thought it would
  be fantastic to have this functionality integrated with org attachments, since
  this provides a means to associate the figure files with org entries, and
  not having to copy files around or enter the path information again and again.
  Also, I wanted to immediately see the results in my org buffer.

  I think that org-attach-screenshot will also be useful for users of
  the more agenda related strengths of org mode.

  BTW: There is another nice generic screenshot library available for
  emacs ([[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/screenshot.el][screenshot.el by rubikitch]]) with some great features, but
  different focus (more generic, allows uploads of screenshots to
  remote servers and offers multiple predefined storage targets). I used
  it at first as a dependency of this module, but since I essentially ended up only
  using the wrapper function for the ImageMagick import command, I decided
  to rather make it independent instead of forcing users to install both.
  I wanted to have an especially well integrated screenshot feature to
  match the org workflow.
